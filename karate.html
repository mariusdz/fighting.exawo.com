          <p>Kyokushin Karate is a traditional Japanese Martial Art, or Budo Karate.
          <br>It was created in the early 1960’s by the founder Sosai Masutatsu (Mas)
          Oyama after his 30 year in depth study of various Martial Arts e.g. Chinese 
          & Korean Kempo, Shotokan Karate, Judo, Goju Ryu Karate, Western Boxing etc.
         <br>The International Headquarters (So Honbu) was opened in June 1964 at 
         Ikebukuro in Tokyo, Japan and the name Kyokushin, meaning “Ultimate Truth”, 
         was officially adopted. Prior to this it was simply known as Oyama Karate.
         <br>In the Martial Arts circles, Kyokushin Karate is often referred to as 
         “The Strongest Karate”. It is renowned for its rigorous training and 
         conditioning, realistic body contact in sparring, the use of tameshiwari 
         (breaking test) technique, heavy reliance on circular motion and disciplined, 
         strictly traditional mannerisms.
         <br>All the above, and in particular the use of circular movement in the 
         execution of techniques, makes Kyokushin Karate rather unique compared to 
         other Karate styles, which mainly rely on simple linear movement and non 
         contact training.
         <br>In summary, Kyokushin Karate can be described as being elegant and serene
         in its movements; refined and stable in its form; classical in its methods, 
         beliefs and protocols, yet very relevant in the 21st century as an excellent 
         method of training mind, body and spirit and a very effective means of self 
         defence.</p>

            <p class="text-left">The symbol of Kyokushin Karate is the Kanku. It is derived from the Kanku Kata, sky gazing
            form. In this Kata the hands are raised to scan the sky and the symbol is formed.
            The points of the Kanku represent the fingers and imply the ultimates or peaks, the thick sections represent 
            the wrists and imply power. The centre represents infinity, implying depth. The whole Kanku is based and 
            enclosed by a circle, representing continuity and circular action.
            Kyokushin Karate begins and ends with points and circles in which lies the strength and the life of the system.

           The word 'OSU' comes from Japanese words 'OSHI' and 'SHINOBU', which mean "to preserve whilst being pushed". 
           It implies a willingness to push oneself to the limits of endurance, to persevere under any kind of pressure..
