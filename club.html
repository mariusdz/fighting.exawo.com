          <p> Exawo Fighting is a member of Exawo group, which 
          is the fitness and sports company. Everyone from age 
          of 6 is welcome to come and train with us.
          At our club there is no such a thing as "beginners 
          course". We train together all the time, it does not
          matter if you've just started or are the black belt!
          During the session we do some basic techniques, lots of
          power, speed and stamina exercises, practise kata and sparring. 
          We attend training camps, participate in various competitions.
          Insurance is the responsibility of the student!

        <p>My name is Marius Dzikas. I am lithuanian 
            who currently lives in Finland and enjoys life here a lot.
            I have started karate at the age of 11 and didn't like it at 
            first, because the training was really hard. But it was worth it.
            Through my journey in Kyokushin karate i was involved in competing 
            at national and international tournaments, taught karate others,
            was participating in training camps and seminars. Karate gave me 
            a lot - opportunity to meet new people and make friends!
            <hr>P.S. my finnish is very limited at the moment. I prefer to 
            speak english or russian. But i will be teaching in finnish and hope 
            you wil help me. Look forward seeing you . OSU!
